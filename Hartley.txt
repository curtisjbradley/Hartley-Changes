CHARLOTTE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
Medical Examiner’s Report by Atlas Hartley
CASE NO.: 2025-0471
DECEDENT: Rob Armstrong, Male, 34 years old
DATE OF AUTOPSY: April 8, 2025
PERFORMED BY: Atlas Hartley, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner
LOCATION: Charlotte County Forensic Facility
Background
I have been the Charlotte County Chief Medical Examiner for the past 5 years. My relevant work experience
and training is listed in my CV.
My understanding is that this case involved the death of a contestant on a reality show called The Saboteurs that
was filming at Hotel Lux. Because the death involved a major media company, Governor Sullivan called and
asked that I personally conduct the autopsy and potential cause of death determination. Seeing as I was not
present at the location of the death when it happened—which would have been surprisingly convenient—I
went to the scene to start my inquiry.
The remains of Rob Armstrong were delivered to the Coroner’s Office in Santa Ivo on the morning of April
8, 2025. I recorded all relevant conditions of the body in the autopsy. The autopsy was conducted using the
standard techniques set forth by the National Association of Medical Examiners, which is extensively peer
reviewed and the gold standard. I also performed all of the toxicological analyses discussed below using
standard, peer reviewed, and gold standard techniques. I have used all of the techniques listed below during
the entirety of my entire career and applied all of them in the same standard manner as I always have.
This report is supplemental to the autopsy report and includes my narrative findings and any testing
conducted after the autopsy was complete.
On Scene Findings and Observations
I arrived at the scene of the death, Hotel Lux, at around 2:15pm approximately two hours after emergency
services had been called to the scene for a reported accidental drowning. The subject was lying on the beach
in a supine position about 150 yards from the water’s edge. The subject appeared to be male and was dressed
in swim trunks and had a small respirator mask lying near the head. The subject’s face also had markings that
lined up with the edges of the mask, suggesting that the mask had been on the subject’s face for some time
before the death. This was confirmed for me by Riley Kaye, who gave me information about the moments
leading up to the death.
Riley Kaye informed me that the subject had been competing in a multi-phase challenge that included diving
into water while wearing the respirator mask. During the dive portion of the challenge, something went wrong
a short while after the dive began and the subject appeared to struggle under water. Then the subject pulled
the respirator off of his face while underwater and started swimming frantically. He was eventually pulled out
of the water by the on-scene rescue divers, but Kaye was vague as to how long it took the divers to reach him.
The time he was pulled out of the water was 12:12 pm. When he was pulled out of the water, he was
unconscious and they attempted CPR for 27 minutes without success. On-scene medical staff called the time
of death at 12:39 pm. Mr. Armstrong’s body was then transported, securely, to the Charlotte County Forensic
Facility for further examination.

Medical History
The subject’s medical history revealed little of note. I reviewed the extensive medical records provided to me
by the show’s producers. The medical records indicated that the subject was a male aged 34 years old with no
known medical conditions except for a documented mild allergy to cats, which presented as allergic rhinitis
(“Hay Fever”). I confirmed these findings with the subject’s personal physician. The pre-testing done by the
TV show also indicated that the subject was in excellent athletic condition and overall health.
External Examination
Besides what is noted in the autopsy report, close inspection of the victim’s face revealed what appeared to be
small skin abrasions near the subject’s mouth and nose. Those could be a result of the subject pulling off the
respirator mask violently but, based on my experience, they were more similar to chemical burns on the skin.
Each abrasion was no larger than 1cm in diameter. There were approximately 8 total in the area of the nose
and mouth. The lividity and rigor were consistent with the time window of death told to me by Riley Kaye.
Internal Examination
First, I examined the subject’s mouth. There appeared to be additional abrasions inside the mouth. These too
appeared to be consistent with chemical burns like I had seen on the outside of the mouth and face. I also
noted minimal signs of allergic rhinitis, including slightly inflamed sinuses and a small amount of mucus in the
nasal passages.
Then I opened the chest cavity using a Y incision. All organs were present, except for the appendix, and all
appeared to be intact. When I examined the lungs, I found that they were waterlogged with frothy fluid that
also extended into the airways. The lungs also had petechial hemorrhages in conjunctiva and pleura, which are
secondary to asphyxiation. All of these signs were consistent with drowning.
There were also signs of irritation and inflammation that you would not see in a simple drowning case. The
trachea and bronchi were irritated consistent with the inhalation of a chemical irritant—they appeared mildly
red and as if they were raw. Most medical examiners would not have seen these subtle signs of irritation, but I
have an extensive background in medical examinations related to many types of poisonings, including
inhalation of foreign substances.
On examination, the brain appeared mildly swollen, a finding consistent with hypoxia, which is the
deprivation of oxygen prior to death. The surface of the brain was smooth, with no signs of external trauma
or internal hemorrhage. No bleeding or contusions within the ventricles or subarachnoid space, and no signs
of blunt force injury. The swelling suggested the victim experienced a period of oxygen starvation, likely
during the final minutes underwater. There was nothing to indicate that any sort of head injury caused or
contributed to disorientation before the death.
The kidneys appeared grossly normal upon preliminary inspection. However, I noticed a slight pallor of the
cortical tissue. This type of change can result from acute metabolic disturbance.
Because of the appearance of metabolic disturbances in the kidneys and the other signs of chemical exposure,
I took additional tissue samples from the kidneys for examination in the pathology lab. I also took the
standard tissue samples from all other organs.
Toxicological Analyses
Using the tissue samples I took from the kidneys, I performed a histological analysis, which involves slicing
the tissue samples into thin sections, mounting them on slides, and staining them with hematoxylin and eosin

(H&E). From that I did not find anything of note. However, I had a gut feeling that there was something
there. So, I then reviewed a fresh tissue sample from the kidneys using polarized light microscopy.
In the polarized light microscopy, certain crystals appear birefringent (show double refraction), which is a
fancy way of saying that they shine brightly when the polarized light hits them. When I examined the subject’s
kidney tissue samples, there were signs of calcium oxalate crystal formation in the tissue samples. Calcium
oxalate crystals typically form in fan- or rosette-shaped formations. Some small crystals had formed
throughout the kidney samples. I reviewed 10 kidney tissue samples to confirm that there were calcium
oxalate crystals throughout both kidneys.
Calcium oxalate crystals in and of themselves are not necessarily reason to suspect poisoning, as calcium
oxalate crystals are the most common form of kidney stones. However, the proliferation of the crystal
formation indicates that this was not an instance where the subject was in the early stages of kidney stone
formation but instead was consistent with the introduction of a substance that would cause such crystalline
formations. A few different chemicals can cause formation of such crystals, including ethylene glycol, oxalic
acid, certain medications, and certain underlying medical conditions.
I ran a basic blood panel on the subject’s blood sample. This showed that the subject had marked
hypocalcemia, which are extremely low serum calcium levels. There were no other notable results from the
basic blood panel.
Because of the calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys, I then ran an advanced blood panel on the subject’s
blood samples to test for some of the less common poisons. The advanced blood panel revealed elevated
levels of oxalic acid in the subject’s blood. The blood gas analysis revealed that the subject was in the state of
metabolic acidosis, which is a dangerous shift in the body’s pH levels caused by accumulation of acidic
compounds, such as oxalate.
I then ran tests for oxalic acid on the rest of the tissue samples taken from the subject. The highest
concentrations of oxalic acid were in the subject’s mouth, trachea, and bronchi. All levels in these areas were
well outside of the acceptable range of oxalic acid in the body tissue.
Discussion and Conclusions
Based on the autopsy and all of the toxicological tests that I ran and my extensive experience with determining
cause of death in poisonings, my conclusion is that the subject inhaled a significant amount of oxalic acid
shortly before entering the water for the dive that he undertook.
The high concentration of oxalic acid in the pulmonary vasculature shows to a high degree of scientific
certainty that oxalic acid was inhaled in powder form. No oxalic acid was found in the stomach contents or
the esophagus, which, therefore, indicates that the only possible manner of ingestion was inhalation. Further,
the chemical burns and irritation observed in the mouth and pulmonary system are also consistent with
inhalation as the manner of ingestion. Based on the levels observed in the blood, the physical signs of
inhalation, and the gender, weight, and build of the subject, I would estimate that he ingested between 1 and
1.75 grams of oxalic acid.
I can also conclude to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the inhalation of the oxalic acid was
shortly before or at the time of the beginning of the subject’s dive.

After inhaling between 1-1.75 grams of oxalic acid, a person of this gender, weight, and physical stature would
Time after Exposure Symptoms
10-30 seconds
Mild burning in throat, mild coughing
1-2 minutes
Onset of dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), continued burning at
site of ingestion
4-6 minutes
Muscle weakness and early signs of hypoxia (visual disturbances, and
confusion)
10-15 minutes
Moderate signs of hypoxia (bluish tint to nails and eventually skin,
tunnel vision, disorientation)
20+ minutes
Advanced signs of hypoxia (poor coordination, slurred speech, coma,
and death)
The effects of hypoxia in divers have been extensively studied. When an underwater diver experiences
hypoxia, it can cause them to panic and lose sense of where they are or which direction is the surface of the
water. Divers have been known to become so disoriented that they remove their masks while still underwater
and try to breathe. This then causes them to drown. While hypoxia is a common symptom of deep-water
diving, the dive in question was no lower than 30 feet below the surface, well above any depth where hypoxia
would naturally occur in a human. While the above symptoms listed in the table correspond to the effects of
oxalic acid poisoning on land, those symptoms all are signs of the inability of the body to have sufficient
oxygen. These symptoms are severely exacerbated in a diving situation where oxygen is limited and any
restriction of breathing requires an accelerated use of oxygen.
I did a review of the dive footage and made notes (Exhibit 5) about the subject’s appearance and when he
began showing signs of struggle. At approximately 5 minutes into the challenge, the subject began swimming
much slower than he had in the prior few minutes or for his athletic level. During the 8-12 minute mark, he
started showing signs of disorientation including appearing like he was not able to figure out where to move
or where to go. Then around the 15 minute mark, he started showing signs of panic, including removing his
mask and inhaling water.
All of the observable symptoms during the dive as well as the physical condition of the body during autopsy
support a finding that the oxalic acid was inhaled within 10 seconds to 1 minute before the dive began.
Overall, my conclusion as to the cause of death is drowning induced by oxalic acid poisoning. While the
ultimate cause of death was asphyxiation through drowning, the medical evidence shows that the hypoxia and
resulting panic felt by the subject was caused by inhalation of oxalic acid moments before the dive occurred.
The physical fitness of the subject and their lack of underlying medical conditions renders it severely unlikely
that the resulting hypoxia and drowning would have occurred absent the ingestion of oxalic acid.

AFFIDAVIT OF ATLAS HARTLEY, MD
After being duly sworn upon oath, Atlas Hartly hereby states as follows: I am over 18 and
competent to make this affidavit.
I am making this affidavit to supplement my report and identify the relevant exhibits that
I am familiar with in this case. Of the exhibits in this case, I am familiar with the following:
Exhibit 3 the autopsy I performed on Rob Armstrong at the Charlotte County Medical
Examiner’s Office on April 8, 2025.
Exhibit 4 is a postmortem toxicological analysis of Rob Armstrong performed by the
Charlotte County Medical Examiner’s Office. The analysis tested Armstrong’s blood, kidney
tissue, tracheal tissue, bronchial tissue and saliva.
Exhibit 5 is an accurate summary of actions taken by Rob Armstrong during the
underwater portion of the challenge on April 6, 2025. I watched the video and I can say that it
details everything Armstrong did from the time he entered the water until he was pulled out by
safety divers.
Exhibit 13 is the label from the bottle of Oxalic Acid that was kept in the supply closet of
the hotel in the basement.
Exhibit 14 is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for Oxalic Acid from the Midlands
Product Safety Commission. It details potential hazards associated with Oxalic Acid, first aid
steps to take in the event of contact, as well as steps for handling, storage, and disposal. I am
well aware of these dangers.
Exhibit 20 is a diagram of the land challenge portion of the elimination challenge from
Episode 9 of Season 10 of The Saboteurs. All contestants had to clear the land challenge to
proceed to the water portion of the challenge. I was told this by Riley Kaye and I also saw parts
of the challenge equipment when I was on the scene.
Exhibit 22 is a still from the footage of the underwater scuba challenge portion of the
elimination challenge on April 6, 2025 before any of the contestants entered the water. The
photograph was taken by The Saboteurs production team for promotional purposes.
Exhibit 27 is the most up-to-date version of my curriculum vitae.
Exhibit 28 is the curriculum vitae of Dr. Grey Marlowe, which I reviewed.

Exhibit 30 is a photograph of Rob Armstrong. This accurately depicts what he looked
like in the video clips I saw of him from Season 10 of The Saboteurs, including the footage from
April 6, 2025.
I reviewed the report of Dr. Marlowe and I disagree with the conclusions made by
Marlowe. There was no reason to suspect that dehydration or exhaustion caused Armstrong to
panic underwater. Further, there was no indication that any sort of medical conditions, either
known or unknown, led to the hypoxia that ultimately killed Armstrong.
I am not familiar with any other exhibits or any affidavits other than my own, unless
otherwise stated in my reports or herein.
I hereby attest to having read the above statement and swear or affirm it to be my own. I
also swear or affirm the truthfulness of its content. Before giving this statement, I was told it
should contain everything I knew that might be relevant regarding the exhibits discussed herein,
and I followed those instructions. I also understand that I can and must update this affidavit if I
remember anything new about the exhibits discussed herein until the moment before I testify in
this case.”.
